the project contains:
1-training images :images in Characters folder that contains 20 images for each character. the neural network is not so accurate because it should have more data 
2- test images : some image to test our neural network 
3- face recognition code to recognize faces, crop them , list them as numpy arrays and save them for neural network.
4-nueral network : a nueral network that can recognize characters. we should make shape and type of arrays standard that it can be used in our neural network.
I have commented cross validation codes to have more data for training our system .we use Cross validation data for making sure that our neural network is working well and prevents overfitting . you can use it if you want to change the neural network
